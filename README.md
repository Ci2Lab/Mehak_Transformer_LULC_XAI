**Transformer-based Land Use and Land Cover Classification with Explainability using Satellite Imagery**
**The work is in progress**
In this project, we introduce a framework designed to enhance the efficiency of Vision and Swin Transformer models by employing transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies. It also examines the significance of interpretability in these models, with a particular emphasis on Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) analysis using satellite imagery. The goal is to improve the performance of these advanced deep-learning models and ensure that their decision-making processes are transparent and understandable. This is a critical consideration for practical applications in LULC classification for areas such as forestry and various agricultural classifications.
